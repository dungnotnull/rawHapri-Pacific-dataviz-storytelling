              As the global climate continues to change, seawater is expected
              to increasingly encroach inland in many parts of the world.
              Behind every number and every chart lies a hidden story - a
              warning bell that calls on us to pay greater attention to the
              growing threat to freshwater security and the communities that
              depend on it - a challenge that is global, not PICs alone.
            </p>
            <p>
              In conclusion, collective action is needed to mitigate climate
              change, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and protect vulnerable
              communities worldwide. Pacific nations will continue to amplify
              their voices on the global stage, advocating for decisive action
              to combat climate change and preserve vital freshwater sources.

              Ensuring access to adequate WASH services is not just about
              survival - it is about dignity, equality, and a sustainable
              future for all.
